# Verilog Implementation of a simple 8-bit Microcontroller

This repository contains the source code for the verilog realisation of a simple 8-bit microcontroller. 
A test bench for testing the functionality of the microcontroller is also provided.<br>
The code has been tested using iverilog version 10.1 and ubuntu 16.04.
