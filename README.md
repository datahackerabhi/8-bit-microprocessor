# Verilog Implementation of a simple 8-bit Microcontroller

This repository contains the source code for the verilog realisation of a simple 8-bit microcontroller. 
A test bench for testing the functionality of the microcontroller is also provided.<br>
The code is well documented and easy to understand so one is encouraged to go through it directly. In case of any queries, please raise an issue and I'll get back to you at the earliest.<br>
The code has been tested using iverilog version 10.1 and ubuntu 16.04.
